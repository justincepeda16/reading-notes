# Day 8 Notes - What I Learned

## On Day 8, I learned the following:

* Understanding comparison operators (with evaluating conditions).
* Understanding logical operators.
* Loops check conditions.
* There are three types of loops: For, While, and Do While.
* A For Loop uses a counter as a condition.
* The difference between a While Loop & a Do While Loop is that the statements in the code block come BEFORE the condition.
