# What I Learned w/ Text Editors

### Text Editors vs. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

In the developer world, I have learned that **Text Editors** simply manages text and text files. Nothing more. Which is okay. As for **Integrated Development Environments**, you get a whole package full of tools that might come in handy as a developer. 

A few examples of what kind of tools that an **IDE** would have are the following:
* Text Editor
* File Manager
* Compiler
* Debugger
* and more!

There are many benefits to using **Text Editors** and **IDEs**, but what ultimately matters is finding the right tools that help you find your "work flow", where you're able to comfortable & smoothly write code at the best of your ability.
