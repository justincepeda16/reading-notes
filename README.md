- In my opinion, **Growth Mindset** is where you learn to react to situations, discussions, and even your own thoughts & actions to where you encourage opportunities to be better at something instead of reacting negatively or being self critical.

> ## **3 Reminders To Myself** 
> 1. _Every_ failure is a new opportunity to learn.
> 2. Even though I don't know everything, it is possible that one day I will, as long as I keep trying.
> 3. I'm here to improve, not impress.
